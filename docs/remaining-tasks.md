# Remaining Tasks Master Sheet (For Interns & Captain)

> **AI-Powered Lead Intelligence, CRM & Outreach Automation Platform**  
> *Filtered task sheet containing **only the remaining 80 tasks** ready to be assigned to interns. Each ticket includes exact file targets, step-by-step instructions, out-of-scope boundaries, and reviewer acceptance criteria.*

## How to Use This Document

1. **For Captains & Team Leads**:
   - Copy the exact ticket text directly into a GitHub Issue on the Captain's repo.
   - Assign the intern and apply the corresponding label (`frontend`, `backend-core`, `database`, `automation`, `ai`).
   - Give each new intern an **S (Small)** task first as a warm-up, then **M (Medium)**, and an **L (Large)** only after two successful PRs.
2. **For Interns**:
   - Check the **Files** column: you are strictly allowed to modify **only** those files.
   - Branch name format: `feature/<TASK-ID>-<short-name>` (e.g., `feature/FE-09-lead-table`).
   - Every task must satisfy all points under **Acceptance Criteria** before raising your PR.

- **Label**: `frontend`
- **Size**: L (Large ~1 week)
- **Needs**: `FE-04`, `FE-06`

#### What to build
- Render a high-performance CRM table with columns: `Organization`, `Job Title`, `Source`, `Experience Range`, `Quality Score Badge`, `Contact Status`, `Assigned To`, `Discovered Date`.
- Implement server-side pagination (page number, page size up to 100) and column-level sorting (`sort_by`, `sort_order`) matching query params in `contracts/openapi.yaml`.
- Wire row selection click callback `onSelect(leadId)` to open the lead detail drawer.
- Support responsive horizontal scrolling on viewports under 1024px.

#### Out of Scope
- Do not build filter dropdowns (covered in `FE-10`), detail drawer content (`FE-11`), or Kanban toggle (`FE-12`).

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Loads and pages smoothly against mock leads.
- [x] Clicking column header triggers ascending/descending sort.
- [x] Clicking a row triggers `onSelect(leadId)`.
- [x] Table scrolls horizontally on mobile/tablet without breaking the viewport layout.

- Sync active filter parameters with URL query parameters so searches can be bookmarked/shared.
- Include a "Clear All Filters" button.

#### Out of Scope
- No saving custom filter presets to localStorage/database.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Typing in search waits 300ms before triggering filter refresh.

#### Out of Scope
- No editing of lead details or contacting recipients from this drawer.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Opens smoothly when a table row is clicked; closes on Escape key or close button.
